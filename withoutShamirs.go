// Package ecdsa implements the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm, as
// defined in FIPS 186-3.
//
// This implementation  derives the nonce from an AES-CTR CSPRNG keyed by
// ChopMD(256, SHA2-512(priv.D || entropy || hash)). The CSPRNG key is IRO by
// a result of Coron; the AES-CTR stream is IRO under standard assumptions.
